/**
 * Per-tx instructions for the orchestrator agent — deliberately short, with the
 * 4-byte selector pre-filled so the agent doesn't have to compute it. Returned
 * as a SEPARATE content block so the agent processes it as a directive while
 * the user-facing verification block stays clean.
 *
 * Why this lives in the response (not just the server-level instructions field):
 * server-level instructions load once at session start and tend to be ignored
 * after a few hundred tokens of unrelated turns. Per-call task hints arrive
 * adjacent to the data they describe, so the model is far more likely to act
 * on them. We accept the per-call token cost as the price of reliability.
 *
 * NOTE: ERC-20 approvals suppress this block too — the signature is universally
 * known, the cross-check would be noise, and the verification block itself is
 * suppressed (Ledger clear-signs approves natively).
 *
 * Issue #625 trim: the directive prose was reduced to imperative checklist
 * items only. The threat-model rationale (why we don't want a verbatim relay
 * of the verification block, why the agent must not duplicate the 4byte check
 * via WebFetch, why preview_send is mandatory before send_transaction) lives
 * in source comments below — the agent does not need to re-read the WHY each
 * turn; the WHAT is what drives behavior.
 *
 * What the trimmed block must still teach:
 *   - relay the [CROSS-CHECK SUMMARY] verbatim as the lead line(s);
 *   - replace the verification-block wall-of-data with a compact bullet;
 *   - end with a single next-step prompt (no menu);
 *   - call preview_send(handle) BEFORE send_transaction.
 *
 * What was deliberately removed (rationale only — present in source for
 * future maintainers, NOT in the per-turn agent context):
 *   - "do NOT WebFetch to 4byte / swiss-knife to duplicate the check" —
 *     the [CROSS-CHECK SUMMARY] block already carries the verbatim-relay
 *     directive; agents that obey one obey the other.
 *   - "do NOT fabricate a ✓ cross-check passed line" — covered by the
 *     verbatim-relay rule on the CROSS-CHECK SUMMARY block.
 *   - "do NOT echo the handle UUID — it is opaque internal state" — the
 *     compact-bullet template names the fields the agent SHOULD include;
 *     the handle isn't on that list, which is sufficient direction.
 *   - "preview_send pins nonce + EIP-1559 fees, computes the EIP-1559 RLP
 *     hash the Ledger device displays in blind-sign mode..." — the agent
 *     learns this when preview_send actually runs (its own agent-task
 *     block teaches the protocol); pre-teaching it here is duplication.

 *     in this comment block: CHECK 1 protects against MCP-side calldata
 *     tampering — if the server rewrote the bytes, the agent's model-
 *     weight decode disagrees with the prepare-time compact summary.
 *     CHECK 2 protects against the server reporting tuple T with
 *     preSignHash=hash(Y) where Y≠T, then forwarding Y to WalletConnect.
 *     The on-device hash match alone does NOT catch that (device sees
 *     hash(Y), chat sees hash(Y), they agree); only a local recompute
 *     of hash(T) from the pinned tuple catches the discrepancy.
 *   - Long SELECTOR-NAME ANCHOR paragraph explaining why 4byte counts
 *     as a separate trust boundary from the agent's weights and the
 *     server's ABI. The compressed bullet retains the rule (\"you MAY
 *     cite the function name from [CROSS-CHECK SUMMARY]\"); the
 *     trust-boundary justification was always for human readers, not
 *     for the agent's per-turn behavior.
 *   - Live-regression note about the column-0 hash render (2026-04-27,
 *     hash showed literal Markdown source under 14-space indent). The
 *     directive (column 0, blank lines above/below, both wrappers,
 *     reuse the wrapper everywhere) stays inline; the historical
 *     context belongs in source.
 *   - Verbose NOTATION section explaining `{a|b}` alternation and that
 *     Markdown link/code-fence syntax is literal. Compressed to one
 *     line; the agent does not need a glossary to read alternation.
 *   - Multi-paragraph SECOND-LLM CHECK + SEND-CALL CONTRACT prose. The
 *     IMPERATIVE bullets stay; the why-each-bullet rationale doesn't.
 *
 * Test contract: every keyword listed in `checksPayload.<x>.keywords`

  //   - The Ledger Solana app clear-signs both ixs on-device — the user
  //     sees the new account address, seed, authority, and rent values.

  //     verify decode) and CHECK 2 (pair-consistency hash) add nothing
  //     a clear-sign user can't already verify with their eyes.
  //   - The cost of running the standard verification block is real:
  //     ~30s of agent prep time on a tx with a ~60s legacy blockhash
  //     window (nonce_init can't use durable-nonce protection since
  //     it's the tx CREATING the nonce). Three live attempts blew that

  // CHECK 2 (pair-consistency hash recompute) fires when the device would
  // blind-sign — without the hash, the on-device screen has nothing but a

  //
  // What the script computes:
  //   - ledgerHash = base58(sha256(msg)) — same value the Ledger Solana
  //     app derives and shows on blind-sign. PublicKey(<32-byte buffer>)
  //     .toBase58() does base58 encoding (works for raw sha256 digests).
  //   - instructions[] = per-ix { programId, accounts, dataHex } extracted
  //     via @solana/web3.js. The script auto-detects message version:
  //       - legacy (no 0x80 prefix): `Message.from(buf)` — instruction data
  //         is base58, decoded via the inline bs58→hex helper below (bs58 v6
  //         is ESM-only so `require('bs58')` fails; the decoder is one line).
  //       - v0 (0x80 prefix): `VersionedMessage.deserialize(buf)` — fetches
  //         Address Lookup Table accounts via an RPC Connection, flattens
  //         static + ALT-resolved account keys, then reads `compiledInstructions`
  //         (data is already a Uint8Array, no base58 decode needed).
  //     The v0 branch requires network access (to fetch ALTs); the script
  //     reads the RPC URL from `SOLANA_RPC_URL` env var with a fallback to
  //     the public mainnet-beta endpoint.
  //
  // The agent inspects the JSON output and reports BOTH verdicts:
  //   - CHECK 1 ✓/✗ on instruction structure (programId + accounts +
  //     dataHex tag) matching the bullet summary
  //   - CHECK 2 ✓/✗ on ledgerHash matching the displayed value

 * Agent-task block emitted when the user has NOT installed the

 * MCP-independent source of truth for agent-side integrity checks — its
 * content lives under `~/.claude/skills/` on the user's disk, outside
 * this server's reach. Without it, a compromised MCP could silently
 * suppress its own CHECKS PERFORMED directives and the agent would have
 * no static rule to fall back on.
 *
 * This block is prefixed to every `prepare_*` / `preview_*` tool response
 * when the skill marker file is missing. It is a UX nudge, not a security
 * boundary: an actually-compromised MCP would of course suppress its own
 * warning too. The point is to catch the honest-MCP case where the user
 * simply hasn't completed the install step, so they don't silently run
 * with a weaker agent.

/**
 * Repeated on every tool response — the pin data the `vaultpilot-preflight`
 * skill's Step 0 (integrity self-check) compares the local `SKILL.md`
 * against. Issue #414: the same pin previously lived in the server-level
 * `instructions` field, which Claude Code truncates at ~2KB. The pin sat
 * ~24KB into the field, beyond the truncation point, so Step 0 silently
 * could not run. Repeating the pin in a short block on every tool result
 * sidesteps the `instructions` truncation entirely — tool results are
 * delivered as separate messages, not subject to that single-field cap.
 *
 * Block shape mirrors the VAULTPILOT NOTICE family — named header, no
 * imperative verbs at the agent, no pasted shell. The closing line labels
 * the block as server-emitted (not prompt injection) and explains why
 * it's repeated. The sentinel value remains assembled from three fragments
 * so a naive search of the agent's context for the full literal won't
 * always succeed and silently bypass the check.
 *
 * Issue #613 finding 5 — kept terse: ~870 → ~510 chars per emission. Step
 * 0 only parses the SHA line + fragment A/B/C lines, so the longer
 * rationale paragraph that used to ride along on every response (~6×
 * across a multi-step flow → ~5KB of repeated copy) was dropped. The
 * source-comment + CLAUDE.md still carry the full story for human readers.
 *
 * Placed adjacent to the JSON result (before VAULTPILOT NOTICE blocks
 * and the verification blocks). Its presence is unobtrusive: Step 0
 * reads it; other turns ignore it.
 *
 * `pin` is passed in (rather than imported here) so this module stays
 * dependency-free of `src/diagnostics/skill-pin-drift.ts` and the call
 * site keeps the single source of truth.

/**
 * Selector classifier for `prepare_custom_call` value-exfil patterns
 * (issue #652, deferred from #493 / PR #494).
 *
 * `prepare_custom_call` is the explicit escape hatch — it BYPASSES the
 * canonical-dispatch allowlist on purpose, gated by
 * `acknowledgeNonProtocolTarget: true`. The v1 user-side defenses
 * (swiss-knife decoder URL, simulation revert reason, on-device
 * blind-sign hash) cover the threat model where the attacker is the
 * agent or a prompt-injection that rewrites args. They do NOT cover
 * the threat model where the user themselves has been social-
 * engineered into running a custom call that drains their wallet.
 *
 * The classifier inspects the encoded calldata's 4-byte selector
 * against a hardcoded ruleset of known value-exfil patterns. Hard
 * "refuse" matches throw a structured error pointing at the safer
 * protocol-specific tool; soft "warn" matches attach a non-fatal
 * annotation to the decoded preview so the user sees the warning
 * before signing without the call being blocked outright.
 *
 * Approve(`0x095ea7b3`) is intentionally NOT in this ruleset — it's
 * already gated by the dedicated `assertApproveRoutedToDedicatedTool`
 * check (issue #556) which carries protocol-spender resolution and
 * its own `acknowledgeRawApproveBypass` escape hatch.
 *
 * Out-of-scope (deferred): cross-contract reentrancy detection
 * (claimAirdrop → transferFrom via pre-existing approval), arg-shape
 * filtering against the contacts address-book, per-protocol
 * allowlists for the target contract.

 * - `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)` 0x23b872dd — ERC-20 pull;

 *   `safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes)` 0xb88d4fde —
 *   ERC-721 transfer. Less commonly abused than ERC-20 since each
 *   tokenId is unique, but worth surfacing.
 * - `setApprovalForAll(address,bool)` 0xa22cb465 — ERC-721 operator
 *   approval. Known phishing vector ("collection-wide drain") but the
 *   legitimate marketplace-listing flow still uses it; warn rather
 *   than refuse. (Selector verified bit-exact against viem in the
 *   test suite — the archive plan's 0xa22cba26 was a typo.)
